# yogaapp
This is a portal where users who want to register for yoga classes can register by paying 500 rupees per month and 
user can decide in which batch he/she want to join. And there are four batches(6 AM To 7 AM, 7 AM to 8 AM, 8 AM to 9 AM, 5 PM to 6 PM).
A new user have to register in this portal and should get logged in to register for yoga classes. And the login page looks like:

And then if you have an active subscription, it shows like:
<br><br>
